👋 Hello, I’m @florence-bain, welcome to my Github page.

:woman_technologist: An East Asian/British woman who wishes to take on the challenge of entering the world of tech. 

👀 I’m interested in creating weird and wonderful things with a passion for technology and its inner workings, motivated to develop and progress in a dynamic career as a Software Engineer, with a real drive to learn led by curiosity. My aim is to learn and contribute to solutions that will make the world a better place, using my skills in tech for good.

🌱 I’m currently learning Ruby and Javascript, and wish to pivot my career into software development full time.

💞️ I’m looking to be an ambassador and role model to/for other women who have also found it difficult to break into the tech industry. I will aim to join a software team working on innovative projects with beautiful design and user experience.
