👋 Hello, I’m @florence-bain, welcome to my Github page.

:woman_technologist: An East Asian and British woman who wishes to take on the challenge of entering the world of tech. 

👀 I’m interested in creating weird and wonderful things with a passion for technology and its inner workings, motivated to develop and progress in a dynamic career as a Software Engineer, with a real drive to learn led by curiosity. My aim is to learn and contribute to solutions that will make the world a better place, using my skills in tech for good.

🌱 I have completed the Makers 16 week bootcamp learning Ruby and Javascript.

💞️ I’m looking to be an ambassador and role model to/for other women who have also found it difficult to find a path into the tech industry. I will aim to join a software team working on innovative projects with beautiful design and user experience.
